My name is Keagan Berstler. Well, pretty soon I'll be named Keagan Greene, since that's my fiance's last name. My middle name is Rose, which is where my 'krosie' nick name comes from (the k is from my first name + rosie). Krosierosie is me. What do I do? Well, I'm graduating from Eastern Washington University with a bachelors in Visual Communication Design, but since some people don't know what that means I usually qualify it by saying it's a major in Graphic Design with an emphasis in Web site design and app development. This website you're on - I designed it. I like use inspiration from various sources then change them to something unique. I have fun with what I do. I chose to take extra classes in User Experience (UX) and in Web design, but I also like to dabble with typography, packaging, and the creative suite ( Adobe Illustrator is my favorite.) oh, and I also have a minor in German. No big deal.
