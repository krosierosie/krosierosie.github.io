[Preserve App](https://invis.io/HDJ9FUIC3MQ)

This project was a group effort. We were tasked with designing an app from scratch. We decided on Preserve. The idea is the user can put in every food item they have in their pantry/fridge/freezer and the app will keep track of when the food expires and warn the user to use the food before it goes bad. It would also show recipe ideas and help create a shopping list.
