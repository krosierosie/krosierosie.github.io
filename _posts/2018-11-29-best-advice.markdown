My French horn tutor back in high school said > Take a breath. The deepest breath you can take. Just when you think you can't take in any more air, take in a little more. Do this until you feel like bursting. Then hold that breath as long as you can. Then let out the air as slowly as possible. Do this over and over. This is how you get the lungs of a great player.
