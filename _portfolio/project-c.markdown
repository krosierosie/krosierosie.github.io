[Library App](https://invis.io/SRL0LTAPTY9#/303310018_logo_Screen)

For this project I was tasked to redesign an app. This one is specifically for the Spokane County Library district. They don't have an app of their own, so I based it loosely off of their website. I wanted to make the content legible and stylish. I also added a few display options they did not have originally to make the user experience much more enjoyable and less frustrating.
