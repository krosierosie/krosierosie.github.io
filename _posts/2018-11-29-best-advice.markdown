My French horn tutor back in high school said

> Take a breath. The deepest breath you can take. Just when you think you can't take in any more air, take in a little more. Do this until you feel like bursting. Then hold that breath as long as you can. Then let out the air as slowly as possible. Do this over and over. This is how you get the lungs of a great player.
I apply this to my manifesto. Just when I think I'm done, make one more change, then another. Keep improving until you can be proud of it. Hold on to the design as long as possible, keep changing it, until I am absolutely sure I am proud of the work I have created.
