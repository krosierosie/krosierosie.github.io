[Movie Trailer Website](https://codepen.io/krosierosie/project/live/AwzwyJ/)

For this project I was tasked on making a website for a movie. Specifically we had to make a video playing the trailer. What is special about this video is not only to I customize the controls to match the color of the website, I made it so it is an independent video player. That means it's not dependent on another video hosting website, like youtube or vimeo. That way it doesn't get ads and it still operates as normal even if youtube is down. Also I had fun with the layout on this one.
